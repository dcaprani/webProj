		 <b>Tips</b><br />
			<ul>
				<li>Never start a match without warming up for
					 at least 5 minutes before commencement of a match.</li>
				<li>Attack whenever you receive a long
					serve, players that play an offensive game generally win more points.</li>
				<li>Practise more often with your
					backhand because the forehand is usually
					stronger than the backhand.</li>
			</ul>

		</div>
			<ul class = "bottom_ul">
				<li>Avoid serving long service while
					playing to prevent your opponent from attacking the ball quickly.</li>
				<li>Keep your eyes on the racket of
					your opponent when receiving a serve rather than the ball, because you don't want
					deception from the server.</li>
				<li>Control your temper when losing
					a match, enquire from yourself what the best solution might be to get back on track, and never
					give up the spirit of sportsmanship while losing.</li>
