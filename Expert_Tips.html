	 <b>Expert Tips</b><br />
		<ul>
			<li>Never start a match without warming up for
				 at least 5 minutes before commencement of a match.</li>
			<li>Attack whenever you receive a long
				serve, players that play an offensive game generally win more points.</li>
			<li>Practise more often with your
				backhand because the forehand is usually
				stronger than the backhand.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul class = "bottom_ul">
			<li>Avoid serving long service while
				playing to prevent your opponent from attacking the ball quickly.</li>
			<li>Keep your eyes on the racket of
				your opponent when receiving a serve rather than the ball, because you don't want
				deception from the server.</li>
			<li>Control your temper when losing
				a match, enquire from yourself what the best solution might be to get back on track, and never
				give up the spirit of sportsmanship while losing.</li>
